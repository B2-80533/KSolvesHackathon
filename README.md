# Anomaly Detection in CloudMonitor Data
## Overview
This project was built as part of a hackathon challenge to develop an anomaly detection system for CloudMonitor. CloudMonitor provides real-time monitoring data (such as CPU utilization, network traffic, disk usage, etc.) in cloud environments. Anomalies in this data can indicate serious issues such as system overloads, network attacks, or resource misconfigurations. Our goal is to detect these anomalies, categorize them, and assign a severity score so that they can be addressed promptly.
