# Anomaly Detection in CloudMonitor Data
## Overview
This project was built as part of a hackathon challenge to develop an anomaly detection system for CloudMonitor. CloudMonitor provides real-time monitoring data (such as CPU utilization, network traffic, disk usage, etc.) in cloud environments. Anomalies in this data can indicate serious issues such as system overloads, network attacks, or resource misconfigurations. Our goal is to detect these anomalies, categorize them, and assign a severity score so that they can be addressed promptly.

## Objectives
### Anomaly Detection: 
Automatically detect unusual patterns in cloud monitoring data that deviate from normal behavior.
### Anomaly Categorization: 
Classify the detected anomalies into different types such as:
#### Spikes: 
Sudden increases in resource usage.
#### Drifts: 
Gradual changes over time.
#### Drops: 
Sudden decreases in resource usage.
### Anomaly Scoring: 
Assign severity scores to anomalies based on how critical they are to the system's performance and security.
### Visualization Dashboard: 
Display the detected anomalies, their categories, and severity scores in an easy-to-understand visual format.
